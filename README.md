# 🔲 RISC-V Reference Soc Tapeout Program By VSD 

Greetings! I am Sai Akhil Cheruvu and this is my repository for the RISC-V Reference Soc Tapeout Program by VLSI System Design (VSD). The program is aimed at preparing participants for advanced work in semiconductor design and VLSI engineering. 

The Key Program Highlights are 🔑 :

1.Comprehensive SoC design journey covering RTL, synthesis, physical design, and tapeout 🎯

2.Emphasis on using open-source EDA tools and flows 🧰

3.Exposure to industry-standard semiconductor design practices  🏭 

4.Participation in one of India's largest RISC-V tapeout projects 📈

5.Collaboration with a wide community of over 3,500 contributors 🤝

6.Contribution to strengthening India’s semiconductor ecosystem and technology leadership 🌱
