# INTRODUCTION TO CIRCUIT DESIGN AND SPICE SIMUATIONS (Day 1)


## What is Circuit Design?


Circuit design is the process of creating electrical circuits that perform specific functions. It involves selecting and connecting components like resistors, capacitors, diodes, and ICs to achieve a desired output. Designs are first planned using schematics and simulations, and then implemented on breadboards or PCBs for testing and real-world use.


## What is SPICE?

SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a circuit simulation tool used to test and analyze electronic circuits on a computer before building them. It models components like resistors and transistors using math equations to predict how the circuit will behave under different conditions. In simple terms, SPICE acts like a virtual electronics lab that helps you debug and optimize your design early in the process.
